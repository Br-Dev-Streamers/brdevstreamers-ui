## ‚ú® Deployment

There is a Dockerfile that already serves an NGINX with SSL.

You can simply, edit the `nginx.conf` file to match your domain:

```
server {
    listen              443 ssl;
    server_name         brstreamers.dev;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/brstreamers.dev/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/brstreamers.dev/privkey.pem;
    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
    }
}
```

Then:

```sh
  docker build -t brdevstreamers-ui .
```

And:

```
  sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -v "/home/brdevstreamers/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" --network host --name brdevstreamers-ui brdevstreamers-ui
```
